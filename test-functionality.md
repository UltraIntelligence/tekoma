# Tekoma Project Tracker - Functionality Review

## ‚úÖ Data Persistence
- **Status**: WORKING
- All 3 comments are safely stored in the database
- User task "Update Chinese Address & Slogan" is preserved
- Task completion states are maintained

## üîç Refresh Button Visibility
- **Location**: Header, next to "Request New Task" button
- **Code**: Present in ProjectTracker.tsx lines 422-443
- **CSS**: Styled with `.request-button` class
- **Potential Issue**: Button should always be visible, not conditional

## üìù Current Data in Production
### Comments (3 total):
1. **p5t2**: Ryan's grammar correction note
2. **p5t4**: Ryan's wording change note  
3. **p3t2**: Ryan's note about stats after G-FIXHSBC revision

### User Tasks (1 total):
1. "Update Chinese Address & Slogan" by Ryan

### Completed Tasks (28 marked as complete)

## üõ† Recent Fixes Applied
1. **Cache-busting**: Added timestamp and headers to force fresh data
2. **State management**: Explicitly set all state properties on refresh
3. **Error handling**: Added alerts and auto-reload on save failures
4. **Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues to Check
1. **Refresh button disappearing**: The button HTML is present in code, check if:
   - Browser is caching old version
   - CSS might be hiding it
   - JavaScript error preventing render

2. **Local vs Production**: 
   - Local development has empty data
   - Production has all your data intact

## üîß Recommendations
1. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Verify you're on the latest deployment
4. The refresh button should be visible at all times

## ‚úÖ Security Features Working
- Rate limiting (5 submissions/hour, 20 comments/hour)
- Input validation (character limits enforced)
- Honeypot field for bot protection
- XSS protection through proper escaping
